        <h1>Machu Picchu - Peru</h1>

            Machu Picchu is an ancient Incan city located in Peru and one of the most spectacular archaeological sites in the world. 
            Construction finished around 1450 CE, during the reign of the Inca Emperor Pachacuti, and its likely function was for religious and 
            administrative purposes. American explorer Hiram Bingham "discovered" the ruins in 1911 and, since then, the site has seen a steady 
            influx of tourists from all over the world flock to admire Machu Picchu's grandeur. Notably, indigenous people in the area were aware 
            of it and led Hiram to its location.Machu Picchu is one of the seven Wonders of the World because it is an incredible example of 
            pre-Columbian engineering and architecture. Not only does it display great precision in construction, but it also demonstrates a deep 
            understanding of astronomy and natural resources. Its location on a mountain ridge between three lesser peaks gives it an impressive 
            view of the Sacred Valley below. The walls are stones that masons carefully cut to fit together without mortar, demonstrating remarkable 
            skill and knowledge. Up to 1,500 people may have inhabited the site, farming the terraced hillsides before abandoning their town due to the 
            threat of Spanish colonists targeting Incan cities. What remains today is intact mainly due to conservation efforts, allowing archaeologists 
            to understand better how this city fits into Inca culture with its various temples, palaces, homes, and agricultural terraces. Its intricate 
            design continues to amaze visitors who wonder at its beauty centuries later.

            Petra is an ancient city located in the Kingdom of Jordan, one of the New seven Wonders of the World. Known initially as Raqmu, Petra was built
             around the 3rd century BC by a tribe of nomads called the Nabataeans. The Nabataeans had experienced architects who made their living by 
             trading spices and incense throughout the Middle East. The city is most famous for its buildings carved directly into sandstone cliffs 
             creating a visual spectacle that fascinates visitors today. Petra's most impressive landmarks are its temples, tombs, and grandest structure 
             Al Khazneh (The Treasury). These structures possess intricate sculptures and handcrafted ornaments observers still marvel at today, 
             even after thousands of years.As Petra was once an important trading outpost for merchants from around the Mediterranean Sea, 
             it prospered over time, becoming an influential center of culture, politics, art, and religion. However, it was eventually abandoned 
             in the 8th century due to economic decline. Today Petra welcomes millions of tourists each year who admire its impressive architecture, 
             rich history, and culture. This archaeological site has made such an impression that it has earned its place among the world's seven 
             new wonders. Academics continue to study Petra, pursuing further knowledge of this ancient city's role in history.

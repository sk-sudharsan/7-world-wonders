        <h1>Taj Mahal - India</h1>
        <p>
            <img id="center" src="C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\blog\imges\TAJ.JPEG" alt="Taj Mahal - India">The Taj Mahal is a grand monument in world history 
            and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan built it in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died from 
            childbearing complications. The construction began in 1632 and took around 20 years to complete. The Taj Mahal is on the banks of River 
            Yamuna near Agra and is an architectural masterpiece that combines elements from both Islamic and Hindu traditions.This impressive structure 
            comprises white marble, precious stones, copper, bronze, and 24-carat gold, which gives it a magnificent appearance. It has four distinct 
            facades, each with an entrance gate—three octagonal while the fourth is pointed—that leads towards the center, where a large dome stands 
            tall above the complex. Inside are several chambers and courtyards overflowing with ornate decorations such as intricate carvings, calligraphy,
             and Persian motifs. The Taj Mahal was listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World in 2007 due to its size, beauty, and historical 
             significance. Today it remains a popular tourist destination attracting millions of visitors each year from all over the globe. 
             Its grandeur inspires awe and admiration centuries after its construction, making it one of India's prideful symbols of continuity 
             through time.

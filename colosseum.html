        <h1>Colosseum - Italy</h1>

            The Colosseum of Rome is one of the most iconic structures in all of history. It was constructed from sand and stone over eight years, 
            (72 AD to 80 AD),  commissioned by Emperor Vespasian, and the city initially named it the Flavian Amphitheater. The Colosseum stands 
            today near the very center of Rome and still stands tall, offering visitors a glimpse into the past. The Colosseum was a place to host 
            grand events such as gladiator fights and public executions. It had a seating capacity of over 50,000 people, with some speculation that 
            more than 100,000 people could fit in its sizeable elliptical design. Under Emperor Titus, the first games included athletic performances, 
            tragic dramas, and wild animal hunts. Gladiators from all over Italy came to show off their skills in battle, creating an exciting pastime 
            for the citizens of Rome.Fire and earthquake destroyed parts of it through time, today's remaining structure still offers a grand view from any 
            angle, something that intrigues tourists from all over the world. Although its purpose has changed since ancient times, now serving primarily 
            as a tourist attraction, its legacy remains one that history refuses to forget.

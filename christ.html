            Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a massive statue of Jesus Christ atop Corcovado Mountain. It stands 98 feet tall and 
            has become one of the world's most venerated symbols of Brazilian culture and faith. This breathtaking monument's story began in the 1850s 
            when a group of Catholics proposed erecting "a symbolic representation of Christianity" as a sign of gratitude towards God for protecting 
            Brazil during WWI.
            In 1992the campaign began with donations from people across the country, and by 1931 construction was underway. 
            Engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and sculptor Paul Landowski used reinforced concrete and soapstone to complete the statue in 1931 after 
            nine years of hard work. The grand unveiling came five years later, in which hundreds of thousands gathered to witness its beauty lit 
            up with floodlights against a dark sky, an astonishing sight still remembered today. Christ the Redeemer also became one of the world's seven new wonders in 2007. 
            Millions visit annually from around the globe, making it one of Rio de Janeiro's most popular attractions, both for faithful Catholics and those merely looking for 
            outstanding views amidst stunning.

        <h1>The 7 Wonders Of The World</h1>
       </marquee>
        <p class="p1"><img class="img1" src="C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\blog\imges\7-wonders-of-the-world-005.jpeg" height="500"width="500">For centuries, human civilizations across the world have built and created cities, buildings, monuments, tombs, temples, churches,
             mosques, and other structures that continue to inspire awe in millions. Narrowing down the world's wonders to only seven is a difficult task. 
             Luckily, the New7Wonders Foundation took the initiative to compose a list of the "new" seven wonders of the world by narrowing down a list of 
             200 monuments from around the world, including some of the world's most famous landmarks. 21 finalists were selected from this list, and the 
             top seven were selected by popular vote. These are the seven new wonders of the world: Chichén Itzá in Mexico, Christ the Redeemer Statue in 
             Brazil, the Colosseum in Italy, the Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu in Peru, Petra in Jordan, and the Taj Mahal in India. Each one offers a 
             unique experience to those lucky enough to see them. From awe-inspiring design elements to hidden stories behind each structure, these wonders remain relevant today
             as they continue to capture imaginations across the globe.
